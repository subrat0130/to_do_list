## Instructions
#### Main Panel
The main panel is where individual tasks will show up. Sort tasks based on due date by toggling the "Due Date" icon.

Hovering over a task will show various options:
* Edit Icon: allows you to edit a current task
* Delete Icon: delete a task
* Box Icon: mark tasks as completed without deleting it from the main panel feed 

Add tasks by clicking on the "Add Task" indicator (located at the bottom of the main panel). Enter in a description, due date, and project name. Tasks without project names will only show up in the Home panel.  

#### Side Panel
The side panel allows quick access to various task categories:
* Home: shows all tasks
* Today: filters for tasks due today
* Week: filters for tasks due this week
* Projects: 
  * filters for project-related tasks
  * shows number of tasks in each category 



## Personal Notes
Project Start: 9/10/2020
For this project, I'm trying a new strategy of taken time to plan things out before coding. Hopefully I can integrate modular patterns, modules, and SOLID principles. 

Project end: 9/13/2020
The project helped reinforce several JS topics: modular patterns, factory functions, IIFEs, single responsibility principle. 

Project update: 9/20/2020
Updated project to incorporate Firebase user authentication and Firestore database. Created a sign-in module that I would also be able to re-use for future projects. Using Firebase/Firestore was an interesting change from the normal HTML/CSS/JS projects.
